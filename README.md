# php_testing

This is a repo I am using to document any small testing of how specific things work in PHP. I am separating the tests into their own files and writing a description of what I learned in this readme and which file it pertains to as well as on the top of the individual file.

## What I learned

1. Using the & sign when assigning a variable as equal to another variable simply creates a reference to it and a change to one will change the other. This only works with named variables, not unnamed expressions

2. You can set up the entire document within a .php document and write php
code directly within the html
